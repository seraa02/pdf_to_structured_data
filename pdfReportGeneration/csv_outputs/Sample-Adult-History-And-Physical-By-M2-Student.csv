002,Differential Diagnosis,Assessment and Plan,Differential Diagnosis,"Sjögren's Syndrome, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)"
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"The patient has a personal history of autoimmune disease and a positive HLA genotype. He was diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis 2 months ago. His presenting symptom of bilateral joint pain in the knees and fingers paired with a positive RF, CCP, and decreased CD4 count made this diagnosis very likely. Sjögren's Syndrome is very heavily associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, estimated prevalence between 17-30% in those with previously diagnosed Rheumatoid Arthritis."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"Another possible cause of the burning sensation is trigeminal neuralgia, a neurological manifestation of Sjogren’s syndrome. However, this patient also presents with some of rarer manifestations of Sjögren's Syndrome."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"According to UpToDate: Clinical manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease, normochromic normocytic anemia can be seen in up to 20% of sjogrens patients."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"Further, “Patients with SS may exhibit abnormal counts in any cell line, and patients with cytopenia often have involvement of more than one cell line“3."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,This anemia could be the underlying cause of the lightheadedness and muscle weakness.
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"Further, a more rare manifestation of Sjögren's Syndrome, is autonomic neuropathy3."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"Autonomic neuropathy manifests as headache, lightheadedness, early satiety, vomiting, weight loss, and sweating abnormalities."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"The patient's headaches with lightheadedness, as well as his GI symptoms and night sweats can be explained by the neurological manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"Finally, autoimmune diseases are often associated with cutaneous manifestations."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"Some of these, such as the malar rash of lupus are well defined, while others are ill defined."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,The pre-auricular rash can be seen as an atypical cutaneous presentation of Sjogren’s syndrome.
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"Plan: A Schirmer test would help differentiate if the burning sensation in the eyes is due to dry eyes or another cause, possibly trigeminal neuralgia."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"Acutely, the patient should be started on corticosteroids to treat the acute symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"Long term, hydrochloroquine or an immunosuppressant may want to be considered."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,This should help with the joint pain and constitutional symptoms.
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Monitoring of RBC and WBC should be continued to make sure they return to normal ranges after this acute event.
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Alternative: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"Assessment: SLE is another very possible diagnosis. The history of autoimmune diseases, paired with the SS-A and dsDNA can point us towards a diagnosis of Lupus."
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,The anemia and leukopenia can also be accounted for by SLE.
002,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,Assessment and Plan,"However, SLE would not explain the facial rash."
